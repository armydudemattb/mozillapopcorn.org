Finally he wanted me to also say that if you vote Republican that you must want to be rich and greedy, or you are a redneck worried about your guns, or you are a religious fanatic. Garry fought many blacks during Junior and Senior High school during the desegregation days in Louisville, Ky where racism ran rampant. Garry has had a recent altercation in which he just fought a racist black guy two years ago at the age of 48, but that will not stop him from voting for the right person to lead this country no matter what the Democrat&#39;s skin color.",
